  <h2 style="background-color:#FFD684">Hard Pill To Swallow</h2>
  <p style="color:white;">If you find yourself experiencing any symptoms of mental illness, consult a trusted psychiatrist. However, it's easier said than done. The first step to coping with mental disorders is to accept that you have one. It is difficult to suffer with a mental illness, but you are not alone in your struggles.</p>

  <h2 style="background-color:#91D6FB">Remember</h2>
  <p style="color:white;">No matter the mental condition, we should always remember that neurodivergent people are still people. It is expected that we respect them and ensure that they are comfortable, but it does not mean we should see them as lesser than. They deserve the help they need as well as the respect given to anybody else.</p>
